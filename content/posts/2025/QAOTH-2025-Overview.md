## 📝 Summary

The QA or the Highway 2025 Conference was a dynamic, one-day gathering that brought together the brightest minds in software quality assurance. Held at The Ohio Union in Columbus, OH, it offered a sharp, experience-driven look at QA in the age of AI, automation, and distributed teams.

### 🔍 High-Level Summary

- **Practical focus**: Speakers shared hands-on approaches and real-world applications of cutting-edge QA tools and strategies.
- **Timely topics**: GenAI testing, prompt engineering, AI agent automation, and accessibility were front and center.
- **Diverse voices**: From industry veterans like Rex Black and Tariq King to up-and-coming professionals, the lineup was as rich as it was insightful.
- **Community vibe**: With breakfast, lunch, giveaways, and collaborative sessions, the atmosphere fostered connection as much as learning.
