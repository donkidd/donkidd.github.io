One possible outcome of spending time gathering Acceptance Criteria for stories is that you have now collected information that can be easily used as test cases.

How else do you go about gathering test cases?

Some things to think about when writing test cases:

Test Cases need to be simple and transparent

Test Cases can & should be written by everyone(different people provide different perspective)

Tests should be able to be rerun and always produce the same results

When you write test cases, do you only test for the good cases?  Do you test for edge cases?  Do you test for errors? Do you check the status of a web service call or do you always assume you will get a 200 response?
