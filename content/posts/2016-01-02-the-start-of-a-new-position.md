# Where to start

As my new job begins, I wonder how this job will be different then my life as a developer. I have been a developer for as long as I know.

## Developer @ [Miami University](https://miamioh.edu) for 15 years.

This will be a big adjustment, instead of creating code, I now get to discover the bugs in the code. Atleast I know good places to look.
I look forward to the automation I am able to help create the build and deployment. Maybe we can start getting into continuous integration.

### So many things to do, whats first?

- Unit Testing
- Test Cases
- Test Plans
- Behavior Driven Development
- Continuous Integration
- so many more

Follow along as I investigate how I adjust to a QA role, and how we begin to create the Quality Assurance Group at Miami University.
