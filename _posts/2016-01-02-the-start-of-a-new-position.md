# Where to start

As my new job begins, I wonder how this job will be different then my life as a developer.  I have been a developer for as long as I know.

## Developer @ <a href="http://Miamioh.edu">Miami University</a> for 15 years.
This will be a big adjustment, instead of creating code, I now get to discover the bugs in the code.  Atleast I know good places to look.
I look forward to the automation I am able to help create the build and deployment.  Maybe we can start getting into continuous integration.

### So many things to do, whats first?

* Unit Testing
* Test Cases
* Test Plans
* Behavior Driven Development
* Continuous Integration
* so many more

Follow along as I investigate how I adjust to a QA role, and how we begin to create the Quality Assurance Group at Miami University.
