I've never tried this but I'm thinking I might atleast try a few of these.
Check out the [30 Days of Testabilty Challenge](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/30-days-of-testability) at the [Ministry of Testing](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/). They are challenging anyone(testers, developers, managers, whomever) around the world to complete 30 challenges in 30 days related to testing.

They have done this before, I've only ever been able to do one of two of the challenges, and never during the actual month of the challlenge, but maybe I can get a few of these done this month, and see where I stand at the end of the month.

If anyone else is trying this, comment below and let me know how far you've gotten.

Here's to being a more testable.
