<hr />

* When do I consider things done?
* Does everyone on my team know what it means for something to be considered done? Do we have a Team Definition of Done?  Do we always follow the DoD?  Do I speak up if I don't think everything is really done? Do we see value in our DoD?  Are there additional things that we can do to improve the quality of what we deliver?
* How can your team improve your definition of done?
* Can Solution Delivery do things to improve our collective definition of done for everything we deliver?
* What are the different things we can create a DoD for?
* TD Tickets? Jira Tasks? Stories in Jira? Projects? Are their others I haven't listed?

* Add comments below sharing thoughts on DoD and what you use it for & how it is used.
