# Location, Location, Location

For those of you who don't know [Miami University](https://www.miamioh.edu) is about 1 hour north of Cincinnati, OH - not in Florida like some may think. So now that we have established where Miami is and where I work for that matter, when I tell you that the [QA or The Highway](https://www.qaorthehighway.com) Conference is located in Columbus, OH, which according to [Distance Between Cities](https://www.distance-cities.com/distance-oxford-oh-to-columbus-oh) its only 118 miles by car, which is like a nice day trip.

# Local resources

For a state institution like Miami, we are trying to get the most out of as little money as possible. I mean my own taxes ultimately pay my salary, right? So We are always looking for opportunites that are reasonably priced that we can get good value from. While [Searching for knowledge](({% post_url 2016-01-15-Searching-for-knowledge %})) I stumbled across the QA or The Highway](https://www.qaorthehighway.com) Conference and I was like awesome, a QA conference in Columbus, OH, no way, that sounds awesome.

So upon further investigation we decided to send 3 Miami staff to the conference, and make a day of it.

# Worth the Investment

So it was definately a long day, we left Oxford around 4:30 am, and journeyed halfway across the state to the Ohio Union on the [OSU](http://www.osu.edu) campus. It was a great experience full of several keynote sessions and several smaller sessions around the building.

# Returning again next year

I will definately be returning next year. This is a good local conference, a way to learn and get experience with local companies and see how Miami can incorporate practices that others around the state have used that we can leverage and learn from.
