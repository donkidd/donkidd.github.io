The focus: human-centered leadership—leading with empathy, purpose, and a commitment to creating a better future. Through experiential case studies and direct collaboration with current leaders, students engaged in timely problem-solving and learned by doing.

## Keynote Highlights: A Career of Service

The opening keynote by Lt. Gen. Richard M. Clark traced an unexpected path: he began at the U.S. Air Force Academy as a football recruit, a start that grew into a distinguished 38-year military career. He didn’t plan nearly four decades of service. Instead, he faced the decision to continue serving at least 15 separate times—and chose service each time. The lesson: service isn’t a single commitment; it’s a choice you return to again and again.

## Leading Beyond the Oath

Clark drew a powerful contrast between military and civilian leadership. In the military, an oath and mission create a clear, shared purpose. Outside that context, leaders must work intentionally to build alignment. Without a formal oath, clarity of purpose and consistent communication become the binding forces that unite a team.

---

## Balance vs. Harmony

Rather than striving for a perfect “work-life balance,” Clark framed leadership and life as a pursuit of harmony. Doing things together—integrating personal and professional spheres where appropriate—can create a more sustainable rhythm than constantly splitting “family time” and “work time.” Harmony emphasizes coherence over competition for time.

## The Making of a Leader

When evaluating leaders (and himself as a leader), Clark looks for three essentials:

- Humility — Acknowledging you don’t have all the answers and staying open to learning.
- Approachability — Creating psychological safety so people bring ideas, risks, and concerns forward.
- Credibility — Aligning words and actions consistently to earn trust.

## Purpose and Focus

Clark didn’t enlist to climb ranks—he enlisted to serve. That grounding purpose became his focus throughout his career. His counsel to students and emerging leaders: keep sight of why you lead. When purpose is clear, decisions simplify, resilience strengthens, and outcomes improve.
