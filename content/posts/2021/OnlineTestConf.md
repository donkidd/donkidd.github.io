# Discovering Quality Education Resources

While working through our QA transformation at Miami, one of the resources I discovered has been particularly valuable for my professional development. Sometimes the best learning opportunities come from unexpected places.

## Virtual Conferences: Ahead of Their Time

Virtual conferences aren't a new thing anymore, especially since the pandemic pushed everyone into remote work. But there's one group that saw the potential early - OnlineTestConf has been running their conferences fully online since 2016, way before it became the norm.

They don't just do this once a year either. They decided semi-annually is the best approach, which means more opportunities for continuous learning. This May marked their 10th OnlineTestConf!

## Get Training Without Going Anywhere

OnlineTestConf solved several challenges we were facing:

- **Budget-friendly**: No travel costs meant we could invest more in team attendance
- **Time-efficient**: Team members could attend sessions without days away from work
- **Flexible learning**: Sessions could be referenced later when implementing new practices
- **Real-world focus**: Speakers shared practical experiences, not just theory

I've been watching their online conference sessions for a few years now, and they're consistently high quality. The sessions continue to provide valuable insights for teams working to improve their testing practices.

## Making Professional Development Accessible

One of our biggest wins in the QA transformation has been making learning accessible to the entire team. OnlineTestConf became a cornerstone of our education strategy, providing exposure to industry best practices that our developers hadn't encountered before.

So head on over to [OnlineTestConf](https://www.onlinetestconf.com/) and let me know what you think. I just signed up and think you should check it out too.
